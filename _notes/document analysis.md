title: document analysis

**"documents are 'social products' that must be examined critically because they reflect the interests and perspectives of their authors... ...and carry 'values and ideologies, either intended or not' ""** 
- (Hitchcock and Hughes, 1995, p.230-231)

- not all of the tools will be equally represented in this sample, is this a problem

After [[data gathering]] ...

The primary data used in this research are instruction manuals, academic papers and blog posts. In so far as is possible all textual analysis tools that are currently maintained and openly avaiable for scholarly use are represented in this sample in some way. The content of documents change given the percieved  purpose of the document so analysis of only one kind of document can lead to a biased data set. By analysing seperate kinds of document which are intended for use in different environments and have different propective readers it is hoped that such bias can be mitigated if not avoided. These documents have a diverse mix of purposes whilst retaining the authority of authors who are experienced if not experts in thier fields .

This sample does not represent all tools evenly as the amount of documents surrounding the tools depends on how long the tool has been in development and the degree of funding it has had over that time. That being said there is at least an instructional document from each tool in this data set.

These documents are made as part of the production process of these tools and as such can provide a rich source of data as to the environment that they envision creating. The documents in this study are not considered to be static entities but rather are situated within the context of the documents surrounding them [(Prior, 2003](/document-analysis-quotes){: .internal-link}. This is why, when available, this study uses multiple documents pertaining to a single technology, to help situate the individual documents in the process by which they were created.  

The coding of this data will pay special attention to the distinction between the production, consumption and content of this data [(Prior, 2003)](/document-analysis-quotes){: .internal-link}. For production for example it is important to consider how a document is put together, a physical instruction manual may have a single author and be published at a single point however most of these online manuals are continually updated by different authors [(Prior, 2003)](/document-analysis-quotes){: .internal-link}. The process through which users findl, access and navigate these documents will also be considered. Using seperate passes to code these documents from each perspective (see also [[coding]]).
