mostly bullet points made from [[initial methods proposal]]

- Investigations interested in understanding current behavior and different trajectories in our interactions with digital space must look at the products of the internet and those enabled by the internet (David Berry, 2012)
- Although often conceptualized as a reader walking through a library and choosing between texts this research focuses on browsing that occurs within text. 
- In the physical world this behavior can be examplefied by traversing through text using sub-headings, contents pages and indexes. Scanning through a text is also an example of this behavior. (Zoellick, 1987)
- Many non-fiction books, especially reference books are made with this behavior in mind. The reader is expected to pick and choose the information they want, not read the books cover to cover.
- Textual analysis tools facilitate a paralelle yet different form of information finding, that is novel to digital technologies (Ramsay, 2014)
