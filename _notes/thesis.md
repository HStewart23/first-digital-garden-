title: "The Digital Sift: finding and processing scholarly information through digital structures"

First some points on [[writing style]]

The  first part of the basic structure of a thesis is an introduction which includes: 
- points on [[relevancy of the topic]] 
- research problem 
- [[research questions and hypothesis]]
- map 

Then comes a literature review which considers the theory from certain areas that are perinant to the question including:
- a definition
-  autonomy as an influential factor in how much browsability you can work into your system  
-  browsing to aid learing 
-  browsing for navigation 
-  the relationship between browsing (as we understand it) and physical space

... and frames them in such a way as to build towards a conceptual framework that can be included in the anlysis

Following these theoretical sections comes the first 'action' section - [[research design]] - this contains: 
-  research question in more detail 
-  data gathering
-  data processing
-  ethics

Then basically you apply the methodology to your data and discuss it using the theory. 
these are the results and discussion section.
- there are some [[critiques to address]] in this section that ought not to be forgotten about

Conclusion to sum up and synthesise everything - make sure no one missed anything

.. then all of the [[sources]] go at the end in a bibliography
