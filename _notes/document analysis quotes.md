"because they were originally created outside of the scope of research, documents can provide a rich source of data pertaining to the day to day activities surrounding the case. Documents can also provide historical information that leads to a better understanding of the case in question and can provide a diverse wealth of information from a wide variety of sources." - (‘Document Analysis’, 2010)

Documents form a field for research in their own right, and should not be considered as mere props for action. 
- Documents need to be considered as situated products, rather than as fixed and stable things in the world. 
- Documents are produced in social settings and are always to be regarded as collective (social) products. 
- Determining how documents are consumed and used in organized settings, that is, how they function, should form an important part of any social scientific research project. 
- In approaching documents as a field for research we should forever keep in mind the dynamic involved in the relationships between production, consumption, and content

(Prior, 2003, p. 26)

      

-   Documents are both receptacles of content and functioning agents in their own right - documents as agents 
-   Document production and consumption
-   The building blocks of the document itself - how the document was put together 
-   What is included and what is excluded ?
-   How does the writer break up the discrete tasks
-   How and by whole was this document assembled ?
-   Who was intended to read it and for what purpose 
-   Methaphors
-   Documents are never inert 
-   How it circulates
(Prior, 2003, my notes)

It is important to consider the author and audience of one's documents
- Some documents are intended as aids to one’s memory, some are reports to others, some as an apologia, some as propaganda, and so on. So documents differ as to their purpose. The more serious the writer’s intention to make a mere record, the more dependable the document.

- The testimony of a schooled or experienced observer and reporter is generally superior to that of the untrained and casual observer and reporter. 
(Caulley, 1983, p. 23)

"documents are 'social products' that must be examined critically because they reflect the interests and perspectives of their authors" (Hamersley & Atkinson, 2007, p.130)

' tell me something about the person that created this document, based on what you infer from the document's appearance and content'... 'each artifact has a history of how it got there and the reasons for and meaning of its presence' - Saldana

'document analysis has traditionally been used as a secondary method to support other kinds of social-scientific enquiry (Webb, Campbell, Schwartz & Sechrest, 1966). However, more recently it has been argued that material culture can function as a primary means of symbolic expression, and thus merits foreground treatment (Goodall, 1991)' - saldana'
