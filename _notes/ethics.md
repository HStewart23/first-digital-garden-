Bullet points

This investigation entails few risks because it is an investigation of behavior via the examination of technologies as social artifacts,  not of individual persons. Additionally there is little risk of revealing proprietary information as all of the data being used is  publicly available data. Furthermore, most of the tools included in this study are either partially or completely open source so proprietary concerns are minimized in any case.
