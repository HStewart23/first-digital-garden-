Understanding of browsing as a behaviour > physical libraries used as example > discoveries from them put onto digital behaviour > this fills the gap as a study on digital environments 

Browsing theory although it has had a recent resurgance in human-computer interaction as a field has been relativley quite since the mid 2000 - to the extent that many of the smaller studies that look into it today site theory that is more than 10 years old and is based upon technology that is vastly different from the technology that we have today both in looks and capabilities.

^this happens because physical libraries have been a subject of study since the 1950s where as digital alternatives to these spaces have not been around for nearly as long as develop more quickly than thier physical counter parts. 

-'They make a useful case study to investigate the comparison between digital and physical information spaces as they exemplify the power of modern data analytics and also have a directly analogous physical action' - qda paper 

This study creates a baseline for investigation such as this by doing an intial analysis across large-corpus analytic tools asking how does the design or large corpus anlytic tools ancitipate the information finding and porcessing behaviour of those who use them. The understanding behind this question is that the experts in this technolgy
