'Data collection is inescapably a selective process' - Bogdan & Biklen 1992

Sampling (from Amanda)
-   How did you choose case studies and interviewees
-   Sources
-   justify number of interviewees
-   describe a little bit better the nature of the technical documents
-   eventually this section will need a breakdown of the numbers of the interviewees
    -   "These participants included 6 women and 8 men; 12 with graduate education; six in HCI, CS, and other technology fields, five in humanities, two in design, and one in education (Figure 6; see Appendix B for detailed table)."

- probs need to justify why focused on tools with discovery
- do I need to justify why I have choosen nVivo ? 
- what kind of design analysis - need theoretical reference for this

I used the [TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research)](http://tapor.ca/home) collection of text mining tools to identify tools text analysis with a special focus on discovery. For each of the texts identified I pulled the text to analyze separetly in nViVo and grabbed some screenshots to analyses the visual lay out of the manuals as well. I also pulled screenshots of the tools themselves for visual design analysis.
