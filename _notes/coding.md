Questions to ask of your coding method 

-   Is the coding method(s) harmonising with your study’s conceptual or theoretical framework?
-   Is the coding method (s) relating to or addressing your research question?
-   Are you feeling comfortable and confident applying the coding method to your data ? 
-   Are the data lending themselves to the coding method ? 
-   Is the coding method providing the specificity you need ?
-   Is the coding method leading you towards an analytic pathway ?

Kinds of Coding

**Attribute coding** \- data management technique 

-   “Attribute Coding is the notation, usually at the beginning of a data set rather than embedded within it, of basic descriptive information such as: the field- work setting (e.g., school name, city, country), participant characteristics or demographics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, health), data format (e.g., interview transcript, field note, document), time frame (e.g., 2007, May 2005, 8:00–10:00 a.m.), and other variables of interest for qualitative and some applications of quantitative analysis. CAQDAS programs enable you to enter Attribute Codes for data sets in related files. “ p.55 
-   Particularly useful for studies with multiple participants/ sites / wide variety of data forms

**Descriptive coding** - for document 

-   Works when you have multiple sources (p.49)
-   “Descriptive Coding summarizes in a word or short phrase – most often as a noun – the basic topic of a passage of qualitative data.To clarify,Tesch (1990) differentiates that “it is important that these \[codes\] are identifications of the _topic_, not abbreviations of the _content_. The topic is what is talked or written _about_.The content is the substance of the message” (p. 119).” p.70
-   Good for begginers learning how to code
-   Works for hierarchies with both descriptive codes and sub codes


 **In Vivo coding**  - attune yourself to values and world views

-   Honours the participants voice 
-   Not necessarily what is wanted for this study


**Provisional coding** 

-   “Provisional Coding establishes a predetermined “‘start list’ set of codes prior to fieldwork” (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 58). These codes can be developed from anticipated categories or types of responses/actions that may arise in the data yet to be collected.The provisional list is generated from such preparatory investigative matters as: literature reviews related to the study, the study’s concep- tual framework and research questions, previous research findings, pilot study field- work, the researcher’s previous knowledge and experiences (experiential data), and researcher-formulated hypotheses or hunches. As qualitative data are collected, coded, and analyzed, Provisional Codes can be revised, modified, deleted, or expanded to include new codes.” p.120
-   “Provisional Coding is appropriate for qualitative studies that build on or cor- roborate previous research and investigations. Miles & Huberman recommend a start list ranging from approximately 12 to 60 codes for most qualitative stud- ies. Creswell (2007) begins with a shorter list of five to six that begins the process of “lean coding.”This expands to no more than 25–30 categories that then combine into five to six major themes (p. 152). 

-   Layder (1998) encourages the search for “key words, phrases and concepts that spring to mind in thinking about the area under consideration before any data collection or even a literature search has begun” (p. 31). Not only can this list serve as a possible series of Provisional Codes, the items can be codewoven (see Chapter Two) to explore possible interrelationships related to the phe- nomenon.” p.121

-   “Be careful - if you go looking for something you’ll find it”
-   Further analysis with provisional codes 

-   content analysis (Krippendorff, 2003; Weber, 1990; Wilkinson & Birmingham, 2003) 
-   mixed-methods research (Creswell, 2009; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003) 
-   qualitative evaluation research (Patton, 2002) 
-   quick ethnography (Handwerker, 2001) 
-   survey research (Fowler, 2001;Wilkinson & Birmingham, 2003) 
-   thematic analysis (Auerbach & Silverstein, 2003; Boyatzis, 1998)


Second cycle methods 

-   **Pattern coding** - adding to meta data - look for similarly coded passages find major themes, patterns of action, networks of interrelationships or theoretical constructs from the data
-   **Focused Coding -** which initial codes make the most analytical sense, putting codes in hierarchies
-   **Theoretical coding** - all categories become linked to one central - most important - category - grounded theory
