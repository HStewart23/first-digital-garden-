The cornerstone of this dateset is the instructional texts that are pulled from each technology. Most often these are supplementary web pages that are linked from different points of the tool. 

A number of questions must be asked when designing tools such as these: who is the prospective user;  what level of technical understanding do they come to this tool with; what problems are they likely to come across? The resulting help texts that accompany such a tool are indicative of the tool creators' answers to these questions. The degree of specialist language is used in the document, the level of technical literacy that is assumed and the kinds of problems that are focused upon are all. These help texts are the main point in which the tool creators interact explicity with the user rather than through thier technology. 

By analysing these instructional documents across the many different technologies that make up this technological field a picture can be formed of how people are expected to behave in these new information environments. The iteration on this research of course is to start studying how they **do** behave.

This research will take these findings and compare them to current theory on browsing.

a) What methods will be used - [Crotty (1998)](/research-design-quotes){: .internal-link} 

This research will use [[content analysis]] along with other visual analysis frameworks to conduct an in-depth [[document analysis]] of artefacts surrounding text analysis tools.

b) What methodology will be employed?  - [Crotty (1998)](/research-design-quotes){: .internal-link} 

Using [TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research)](http://tapor.ca/home) I will collect a sample of text anlayis tools specifically mentioning information 'discovery' as part of thier product brief. [I will then strip the help text from the site and take screenshots to allow for a visual anlaysis of the UI. I may also run my own corpus through the software to see what I can find.](/data-gathering){: .internal-link}. I will also look for the published articles and blog posts that sometimes accompany these projects. 

Using the methodologies above I will the [code](/coding){: .internal-link} and otherwise [process](/data-processing){: .internal-link} my data. Following this I will analyise the results through my [[conceptual framework]].

c) What theoretical perspective will support the research proposal? - [Crotty (1998)](/research-design-quotes){: .internal-link} 

Effective scholarly work requires a measure of browsing because browsing has been shown to be an influential mechanism through which scholars select relevant resources and make novel connections.  Most of the research that we currently have on such behavior is based on studies done in physical environments such as libraries. Given general trends towards online tools that replace libraries and the potential acceleration towards this given the events of the past year which has driven many of us into our homes this does not reflect the reality and likely future of scholarly work. 

Textual analysis tools are growing in popularity in many fields as a method of understanding large bodies of text. I argue that they are one of the tools that is replacing the digital library as a place of research. They encourage a reader to look *through* an corpus at a glance rather than having to read each of the texts individually. This is a form of information traversal that is similar to hypertext.     

d) What epistemology will inform the research proposal?  - [Crotty (1998)](/research-design-quotes){: .internal-link} 

This proposal comes from an interpretivist stance. It seeks to examine current understandings of academic 'browsers' and their information needs and behaviors specifically within the environment of textual analysis interfaces.
