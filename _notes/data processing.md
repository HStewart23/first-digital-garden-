primary methodology : [[document analysis]] & [[content analysis]] as part of an overall case study framework

These will be analysed via the [[coding]] schema. The results of this analysis will be situated in current browsing theory. 

My notes on past coding experiences. 
- 'These needs realized themselves in an eclectic coding scheme with initial provisional codes based on theory and descriptive codes that were developed as the researcher became familiar with the text' - qda (me)
- 'After the first iteration, it was also decided to include magnitude coding to help the researcher label the documents. Saldaña (2009) notes that ‘pragmatic eclecticism’ can be very useful so long as the individual coding methods are coherent with one another. In this case, it was felt that the discrete need that each of these methods filled surrounding this research project gave them the necessary coherence' - qda (me)
- 'The codes in the scheme were accompanied by a definition and some key phrases as recommended by Layder (1998).' - qda (me)
- sentiment analysis ? - qda (notes, me)

More specificially: Using large-corpus analysis tools as case study. I will do a content analysis and a more general document analysis on the help manuals that accompany the tools as well as academic articles that are often published along side them. Some of the creators who build these tools also post blog  Examining technical document and academic papers as products of an intentional creation process and anlysing the implications of this creation using
