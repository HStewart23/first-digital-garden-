---

from Owens 2014 : 

Michael Crotty’s (1998) questions for research design quotes:
a) What methods will be used;

“the techniques or procedures used to gather and analyze data related to some research question or hypothesis” (p. 3).

b) What methodology will be employed;

“the strategy, plan of action, process, or design” (p. 3) behind the choice and use of specific methods?

c) What theoretical perspective will support the research proposal?

“the philosophical stance informing the methodology and thus providing a context for the process and grounding it’s logic and criteria” (p. 3).

d) What epistemology will inform the research proposal?

question according to Crotty is what epistemology will inform a research proposal or what is “the theory of knowledge embedded in the theoretical perspective and thereby the methodology” (p. 3)? Examples of epistemologies include objectivism, subjectivism, and the epistemological stance for my study, social constructivism

The interpretivisit approach, “to the contrary, looks for culturally derived and historically situated interpretations of the social world” (Crotty, 1998 p. 67).
