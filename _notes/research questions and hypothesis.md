title: research questions and hypothesis
---

past question :  'How do natural language processing tools for the exploration of digital texts affect or challenge previous conceptions of browsing?'

past hypothesis (methods paper):  'The hypothesis of this research is that the changing nature of data in our society (Zuboff, 2019) has likely influenced the normative concepts that describe our relationships to that data, concepts such as browsing. It is therefore the purpose of this research to consider prominent browsing conceptualisation frameworks from the 1990s and early 2000s and compare them to modern technology within the realm of digital humanities in order to consider if they still fit and are as unilaterally relevant as their usage would suggest.''

current question: 
Considering the prevelence of large corpus analytics tools in the digital humantities and human-computer interaction studies **how does the design of large corpus analytics tools anticiptate the information finding and processing behaviour of those who use them ?** 

question I'm not sure I can ask: 
How will this effect the kind of knowlege that can be produced from these technologies
