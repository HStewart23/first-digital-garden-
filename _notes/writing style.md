J. Dunleavy, Authoring a PhD: How to plan, draft, write and finish a doctoral dissertation or thesis. Palgrave, 2003

The discipline and according conventions that I will use are: 
	- Think about how you label schools of thought in your discipline and how you talk about your own work
	- get some good academic jargon on your side, not too much but used stuff that is relevant to your field
	- judge all elements of your presentation (including jargon because it may indicate allegiances with different standpoints)


Tips: 

Acessability/ Readability: 
- 'write your thesis to be accessible to the widest feasible readership, clear and accessible text is very important'
-  use 'orienting devices' (signposting)

Introduction
-   you need to make statements about what the study will accomplish so that everything is directed and the relevancy is clear
-   what is your dissertation about
-   what contribution do you aim to achieve
-   what will be new or different about your work

Research Questions
- the scope of the question needs to match the scope of the answer
- the question should not just fit a gap in the literature but should also advance a wider intellectual purpose

pose your question around an intellectual problem. An intellectual problem has four components. this is problematizing your question.
-   a goal or objective that can tell us how to judge outcomes, how to measure what is achieved by the answer
-   initial state - the starting situation and the resources available to be used (usually existing literature)
-   a set of operations that can be used to change the initial state and resources (e.g new data/ research methods)
-   constraints: designating certain kinds of operations as inadmissible

You may need to shape the question to frame your findings


Literature Reviews
-   lots of thesis start by tearing down a lack of research in their field - literature reviews are often written too early on to fully appreciate that the problem may not just be solvable by bringing in a different theory
-   after you have show what was wrong previously, the reader has to have faith that you can put it right so the more criticisms you make the higher the bar for your own research

General pacing and advice 
- aim for similarly sized sections: diving text as evenly as possible creates consistent and more readable writing
- You need a major heading to break up text every 2000 - 2500 words
- Main sections shorter than 2000 often seem bitty or insubstantial
- In 15000 you should have 6 - 8 large headings - these are first-order headings because they are the top organizers you can point these out to readers by: numbering them, using large font, and formate that makes them stand out from the rest of the text or/and locating them prominently - on an otherwise blank line of their own
-   second-order headings can be signaled by : intermediate sized font, locating them on a blank line but left aligned, by not numbering them.
-   sometimes 3rd order headings are also important, use common sense
-   try not to use 4th order sub headings
-   Let the headings express the hierarchy
-   intro/ conclusion 200 - 1000 words: don't add a subheading for the intro, people know what it is, conclusion should be a 2nd order heading
-   good headings should accurately characterize your text - ideally they should indicate your argument and the coming topic. 1-2 words minimum to 7-8 words max, don't just do question headings: questions are not answers. People are looking to your work for answers, not questions.
-   well organised authors make promises - I will show that... this demonstrates that ...
